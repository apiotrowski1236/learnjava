## Get [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
A great developer environment loved by all Java developers! Students get free access to the professional version, which is an AMAZING deal! But the community version will also work juts as well.

## Make IntelliJ Better
### Theme
Setting up IntelliJ comes with the biggest decision a software developer will ever make-  what [IntelliJ theme](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/search?tags=Theme) will you choose?  

### Another huge decision: 
[Nyan cat](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8575-nyan-progress-bar) or [Pokemon](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15090-pokemon-progress) progress bar? (There are probably a million more wacky versions of the progress bar)

### [Rainbow Brackets](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10080-rainbow-brackets) . 
Never have a bug again because you didn’t properly close your brackets or parentheses! 

## [Key Promoter X]( https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9792-key-promoter-x) 
A plugin that helps teach you all the shortcuts in IntelliJ. Save a couple of milliseconds each time you code! It’ll add up. 

## Heads-up: 
For all plugins, just make sure that it’s a popular Plugin before adding it to your IntelliJ; otherwise it might be pretty buggy and slow your IntelliJ down. You can check how many users it has -  for example, the Nyan Cat plugin has over a million users. 

# Save and Share your code: 

# [Github](https://github.com/signup)
A source control system (that you are currently using!) that makes it easy to share your code + return back to your last good state if you encounter a bug.
Also, a  lot of software devs put their Github link in their resumes.    

# Behind the scenes developer tools:
- Setup the [JDK (Java Development Kit)]( https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-set-up-java-development-environment-a-comprehensive-guide/) 
- Git 
How you’ll interact with Github from your computer.The [instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) vary depending on whether you’re using an Apple or Windows computer:
